# Randomized exercises for Moodle

There are several dozens of exercises in the following fields of Computer Architecture:
1. Binary arithmetic
2. Bit operations
3. Floating point
4. Fixed point
5. Unicode
6. Synthesis
7. Addressing
8. Stack
9. Paging
10. Cache
11. Predictors

The exercises are exported from Moodle. Every exercise contains a set of numeric variables but without their ranges and precision. To apply the exercises, a user must supply the variable ranges and precision. The ranges are described in the accompanying file RandomEx.docx. The precision is always integer (0 digits after point).
